CREATING A LANDING PAGE

A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. 

It requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

Through this project, we'll learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. 

The most important aspect is unleashing our creativity to design an impressive page. 

Paying attention to alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Using CSS to avoid overlapping
elements. 

In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills,
and being creative while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
